# Sirona Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sirona Project! This repository contains the codebase and documentation for a specialized parachain built on the Polkadot network. Our parachain aims to provide a unique solution for people seeking psychiatric therapy, leveraging the interoperability, scalability, and security of the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Features

-   **Interoperability:** Seamlessly communicate with other parachains and the Polkadot Relay Chain.
-   **Scalability:** Achieve high throughput and low latency for transactions and smart contract executions.
-   **Security:** Benefit from the shared security model of the Polkadot network, ensuring robust protection against attacks.
-   **Custom Logic:** Implement specialized logic and features tailored to [specific use case or industry].
-   **Governance:** Decentralized governance model to allow the community to propose and vote on network upgrades and changes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the parachain locally or deploy it to a network, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-   [Substrate](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/)
-   [Polkadot JS API](https://polkadot.js.org/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sirona-chain/parachain.git
    cd parachain
    ```

2. Install Rust and Substrate dependencies:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    rustup update nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
    ```

3. Build the parachain:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

## Start a development chain

Firstly build Polkadot binaries with:

```sh
$ scripts/zombienet.sh build
```

This process can take some time, so please be patient. If on Linux, you can alternatively download the binaries to speed up the process with:

```shell
$ scripts/zombinet.sh init
```

Once Polkadot binaries are in place you can spawn a local testnet by running the following command:

```shell
$ scripts/zombienet.sh devnet
```

Connect to the local node using Polkadot.js Apps or any compatible UI to interact with the parachain.

```shell
https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.01:33975#/explorer
```

```shell
https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9933#/explorer
```

## Usage

### Interacting with the Parachain

Use the Polkadot.js Apps or any compatible wallet and UI to:

-   Send and receive tokens.
-   Deploy and interact with smart contracts.
-   Participate in governance processes.
-   Monitor network activity and health.
